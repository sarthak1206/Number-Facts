# Number-Facts Application

This is a java-based android application through which you can generate some random facts about any integer number.



## About the project

In this project, I have tried to use an API from http://numbersapi.com with the help of an array of json object. It helps in generating random facts about the number in which you can see the facts generated by that API only.
